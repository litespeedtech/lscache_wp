== Installation ==

[View detailed documentation](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/installation/).

= For Optimization Without a LiteSpeed Web Server =
1. Install the LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress plugin and activate it.
1. From the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > Page Optimization**. Enable the available optimization features in the various tabs.

= For Caching and Optimization With a LiteSpeed Web Server =
1. Install [LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-server) with LSCache Module, [LiteSpeed Web ADC](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-adc), or [OpenLiteSpeed](https://www.litespeedtech.com/open-source/openlitespeed) with cache module (Free). Or sign up for [QUIC.cloud CDN](https://quic.cloud).
1. Install the LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress plugin and activate it.
1. From the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > Cache**, make sure the option **Enable LiteSpeed Cache** is set to `ON`.
1. Enable any desired caching and optimization features in the various tabs.

= Notes for LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise =

* Make sure that your license includes the LSCache module. A [2-CPU trial license with LSCache module](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-server/download/get-a-trial-license "trial license") is available for free for 15 days.
* The server must be configured to have caching enabled. If you are the server admin, [click here](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/start/#configure-cache-root-and-cache-policy) for instructions. Otherwise, please request that the server admin configure the cache root for the server.

= Notes for OpenLiteSpeed =

* This integration utilizes OpenLiteSpeed's cache module.
* If it is a fresh OLS installation, the easiest way to integrate is to use [ols1clk](https://openlitespeed.org/kb/1-click-install/). If using an existing WordPress installation, use the `--wordpresspath` parameter.
* If OLS and WordPress are both already installed, please follow the instructions in [How To Set Up LSCache For WordPress](https://openlitespeed.org/kb/how-to-setup-lscache-for-wordpress/).

== Third Party Compatibility ==

The vast majority of plugins and themes are compatible with LSCache. [Our API](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/api/) is available for those that are not. Use the API to customize smart purging, customize cache rules, create cache varies, and make WP nonce cacheable, among other things.

== Privacy ==

This plugin includes some suggested text that you can add to your site's Privacy Policy via the Guide in the WordPress Privacy settings.

**For your own information:** LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress potentially stores a duplicate copy of every web page on display on your site. The pages are stored locally on the system where LiteSpeed server software is installed and are not transferred to or accessed by LiteSpeed employees in any way, except as necessary in providing routine technical support if you request it. All cache files are temporary, and may easily be purged before their natural expiration, if necessary, via a Purge All command. It is up to individual site administrators to come up with their own cache expiration rules.

In addition to caching, our WordPress plugin has online features provided by QUIC.cloud for Image Optimization, CSS Optimization and Low Quality Image Placeholder services. When one of those optimizations are requested, data is transmitted to a remote QUIC.cloud server, processed, and then transmitted back for use on your site. Now if using the QUIC.cloud CDN it uses LSCache technologies to access your site then host your site to others globally and also your data is not transferred to or accessed by QUIC.cloud employees in any way, except as necessary in providing maintenance or technical support. QUIC.cloud keeps copies of that data for up to 7 days and then permanently deletes them. Similarly, the WordPress plugin has a Reporting feature whereby a site owner can transmit an environment report to LiteSpeed so that we may better provide technical support. None of these features collects any visitor data. Only server and site data are involved.

Please see the [QUIC.cloud Privacy Policy](https://quic.cloud/privacy-policy/) for our complete Privacy/GDPR statement.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do the cache features require LiteSpeed Server? =
This plugin communicates with your LiteSpeed Web Server and its built-in page cache (LSCache) to deliver superior performance to your WordPress site. The plugin’s cache features indicate to the server that a page is cacheable and for how long, or they invalidate particular cached pages using tags.

LSCache is a server-level cache, so it's faster than PHP-level caches. [Compare with other PHP-based caches](https://www.litespeedtech.com/benchmarks/wordpress).

A page cache allows the server to bypass PHP and database queries altogether. LSCache, in particular, because of its close relationship with the server, can remember things about the cache entries that other plugins cannot, and it can analyze dependencies. It can utilize tags to manage the smart purging of the cache, and it can use vary cookies to serve multiple versions of cached content based on things like mobile vs. desktop, geographic location, and currencies. [See our Caching 101 blog series](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/tag/caching-101/).

If all of that sounds complicated, no need to worry. LSCWP works right out of the box with default settings that are appropriate for most sites. [See the Beginner's Guide](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/beginner/).

**Don't have a LiteSpeed server?** Try our QUIC.cloud CDN service. It allows sites on *any server* (NGINX and Apache included) to experience the power of LiteSpeed caching! [Click here](https://quic.cloud) to learn more or to give QUIC.cloud a try.

= What about the optimization features of LSCache? =

LSCWP includes additional optimization features, such as Database Optimization, Minification and Combination of CSS and JS files, HTTP/2 Push, CDN Support, Browser Cache, Object Cache, Lazy Load for Images, and Image Optimization! These features do not require the use of a LiteSpeed web server.

= Is the LiteSpeed Cache Plugin for WordPress free? =

Yes, LSCWP will always be free and open source. That said, a LiteSpeed server is required for the cache features, and there are fees associated with some LiteSpeed server editions. Some of the premium online services provided through QUIC.cloud (CDN Service, Image Optimization, Critical CSS, Low-Quality Image Placeholder, etc.) require payment at certain usage levels. You can learn more about what these services cost, and what levels of service are free, on [your QUIC.cloud dashboard](https://my.quic.cloud).

= What server software is required for this plugin? =

A LiteSpeed solution is required in order to use the **LiteSpeed Exclusive** features of this plugin. Any one of the following will work:

1. LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise with LSCache Module (v5.0.10+)
2. OpenLiteSpeed (v1.4.17+)
3. LiteSpeed WebADC (v2.0+)
4. QUIC.cloud CDN

The **General Features** may be used with *any* web server. LiteSpeed is not required.

= Does this plugin work in a clustered environment? =

The cache entries are stored at the LiteSpeed server level. The simplest solution is to use LiteSpeed WebADC, as the cache entries will be stored at that level.

If using another load balancer, the cache entries will only be stored at the backend nodes, not at the load balancer.

The purges will also not be synchronized across the nodes, so this is not recommended.

If a customized solution is required, please contact LiteSpeed Technologies at `info@litespeedtech.com`

NOTICE: The rewrite rules created by this plugin must be copied to the Load Balancer.

= Where are the cached files stored? =

The actual cached pages are stored and managed by LiteSpeed Servers.

Nothing is stored within the WordPress file structure.

= Does LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress work with OpenLiteSpeed? =

Yes it can work well with OpenLiteSpeed, although some features may not be supported. See **Plugin Features** above for details. Any setting changes that require modifying the `.htaccess` file will require a server restart.

= Is WooCommerce supported? =

In short, yes. However, for some WooCommerce themes, the cart may not be updated correctly. Please [visit our blog](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2017/05/31/wpw-fixing-lscachewoocommerce-conflicts/) for a quick tutorial on how to detect this problem and fix it if necessary.

= Are my images optimized? =

Images are not optimized automatically unless you set **LiteSpeed Cache > Image Optimization > Image Optimization Settings > Auto Request Cron** to `ON`. You may also optimize your images manually. [Learn more](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/imageopt/).

= How do I make a WP nonce cacheable in my third-party plugin? =

Our API includes a function that uses ESI to "punch a hole" in a cached page for a nonce. This allows the nonce to be cached separately, regardless of the TTL of the page it is on. Learn more in [the API documentation](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/api/#esi). We also welcome contributions to our predefined list of known third party plugin nonces that users can optionally include via [the plugin's ESI settings](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/cache/#esi-nonce).

= How do I enable the crawler? =

The crawler is disabled by default, and must be enabled by the server admin first.

Once the crawler is enabled on the server side, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > Crawler > General Settings** and set **Crawler** to `ON`.

For more detailed information about crawler setup, please see [the Crawler documentation](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/crawler/).
